# Snowman
Okay, so this uses Visual studio, Coin3D (free OpenInventor), Qt, and Quarter (connects Coin3d and Qt)
Basic playing around, build a snowman
Will need to change the linking to the correct pathway for libraries and include directories
Also, make sure configuation of libraries was done with the same type as the configuration used in visual studio
